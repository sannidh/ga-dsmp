### Project Overview

 This project involves the use of python's numpy module to analyze and drive decision making on the data consisting of census information. The features constitute as follows:

- age
- education (in years)
- race (0-4)
- gender(0,1)
- capital-gain
- capital-loss
- hours-per-week
- income(<=50k or >50k)


### Learnings from the project

 The analysis is done on various subsets of the main census array by the following methods:

- Array Appending
- Array Slicing
- Array Filtering
- Array Aggregation



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The analysis consists of:

- Education vs pay - if higher education results in higher income
- Age vs working hours - if the rules of senior citizenship are followed
- Race vs population - if any race singled out as minority can have significant impact on income
