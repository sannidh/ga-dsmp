### Project Overview

 **Loan Defaulters**

- [ ] Classify borrowers based on DecisionTreeClassifier model as paying back loaners or defaulters
- [ ] int.rate, annual income, credit period, fico score are among the 16-17 features provided for each borrower


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 **Steps performed on the dataset**

- [ ] Drop non-consequential columns like customer ID and the target variable
- [ ] Split the dataset into training and testing data set in 70:30 ratio
- [ ] Studying the distribution of target variable using matplotlib
- [ ] Feature engineering to prep up data for modelling
- [ ] Visualizing numerical as well as categorical features against target variable i.e paid back loan status
- [ ] Building a decision tree to fit the model, getting the accuracy
- [ ] Tuning hyperparameters of the decision tree by pruning to prevent overfitting & improve accuracy
- [ ] Visualizing the classifier
