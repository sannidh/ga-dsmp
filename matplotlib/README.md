### Project Overview

 Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Their loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. To create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments, a comprehensive analysis of the data collected is presented. The following operations are performed on the dataset.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Visualizing the company's record with respect to loan approvals - does a high approval rate affect company's health
2. Check loan approval distribution across the regions
3. Does higher education result in a better guarantee in issuing loans? Stability in career vs propensity to get loans
4. Whether being graduate or not also leads to different loan amount distribution by plotting an overlapping density plot ?
5. Correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount
