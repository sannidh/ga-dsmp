### Learnings from the project

 - Loading and visualizing the general data
- Making visual inferences from data - We are interested to know what's the stand of the members of 'ASB'. Does good overpower evil or does evil overwhelm good? 
- Finding correlations between different attributes - Combat skills are really important to survive when superheroes find themselves in unwanted situtations. But does combat correlate to person's strength or intelligence?
- Visualizing the major aspects that would determine the end result - Speed & Power are most distributed aspects of superpowers. Whereas Intelligence is least dispersed. So humans would need to improve intelligence to be able to survive against these, just in case.
